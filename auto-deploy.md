# auto deploy

To create a shell script that automatically clones a Git repository and deploys the code, you can use the following commands:

````
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/username/repository.git

# Move into the repository directory
cd repository

# Run the deployment script (assuming it is called deploy.sh)
./deploy.sh
````

You can then save these commands in a shell script file (e.g. deploy.sh) and run it whenever you want to clone the repository and deploy the code.

Make sure that the script has permission to execute, you can do that with:

````
chmod +x deploy.sh
````

and run the script with

````
./deploy.sh
````

Note: The above script assumes that you have already set up Git and that your system has the necessary dependencies for running the deployment script (if any).
